//!
//! The build is pure and offline (no engine syscalls): it asks the hull-1 solidity oracle
//! ([`Bsp::is_solid`], a point test that already accounts for the player box) where a player
//! can stand, drops a [`Cell`] at each floor, and classifies the moves between nearby cells
//! into [`Link`]s (walk / step / drop / jump). Costs are travel times, so A* over the graph
//! yields fast routes (P2).

//! The static-hull cut emits `Walk`/`Step`/`Drop`/`JumpGap`; on top of it come `DoubleJump`,
//! `SpeedJump`, `Hook`, and `RocketJump` movement links (each solved offline against the same
//! solidity oracle), and the entity-derived `Plat`/`Teleport`/gate splices.
